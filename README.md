DiabeteHelper - STOPPED 19/07/2017
=========

The developpement of this app has stopped, considering there is an app doing everything i wanted to include in my website, i think there is no point in continuing developpement of this app.
Last developpement 17/07/2017

A Symfony project created on March, 2016.

Note that the website is under active developpement and i can't guarantee the security of datas yet. You can test the website but any datas you store here belong the me for the time of developpement phase and you can't charge me for anything that happens to them.

For those who would like to help or get more informations, feel free to contact me on github or millt.nico[at]hotmail.fr
